Overview

In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with  Node, Express, Handlebars and use sequelize to convert your old ORM to Sequelize. Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and Sequelize to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

In this app, the user can add any burger that their heart desires and submit it, all new items will appear in the left side of the screen, then they can click devour and it will appear to the right of the screen.

Object of this project is to display your database on to the users screen and have the data update in real time.

Technologies used, Node.js, Express, Handlebars, Sequelize, HTMl, CSS.
